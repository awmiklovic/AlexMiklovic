				Laguna Art Museum collects and exhibits art created by California natives exclusively, depicting the life and history of the state. In addition to showcasing the most diverse and significant regional pieces, it is regarded as an educational, cultural, and social center for children, students, and adults in the community.

				Laguna Art Museum was one of the many opportunities I had to work with the graphic and web design studio, <a href="http://www.studiomisfits.com" target="_blank">Studio Misfits</a>. They did an excellent job designing this website, and I was able to work with them by covering all development for this project.
